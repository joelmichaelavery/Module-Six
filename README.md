# Module-Six

This program contains a dictionary with 15 nfl teams and where they are from. It loops through the dictionary and then asks the user to select a team. The program then says where that team is from and then asks if they would like to continue, if no the program terminates. There is input validation to make sure the correct data is input and output.
